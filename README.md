# Single-Cell-RNA-seq-analysis


This scRNA-seq analysis was conducted using a publicly available dataset from four HNSCC patients. Dataset was used to test the efficiency and corrected of the semi-automated celltype annotation tool, SingleR, sourcing reference data from the Bluerpint ENCODE projectâ€”comprising bulk RNA-seq profiles of flow cytometry-sorted cell types.
